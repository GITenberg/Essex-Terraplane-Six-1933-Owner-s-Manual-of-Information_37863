<p>
Keep Radiator Full                             Keep Oil Reservoir Full<br />
</p>


<p>Heat is a major consideration in a new engine. Do not allow the engine to
overheat. Although the heat indicator on the instrument panel shows the
general temperature of the engine, it will not show a sudden rise in temperature
of an individual part.</p>

<p>The pressure imposed on parts such as bearings and pistons due to rapid
acceleration or hard pulling will cause them to overheat if the car has not been
driven sufficiently to break them in. Avoid fast acceleration and hard pulling
while breaking in.</p>

<p>High speed also develops higher operating temperatures and to avoid damage
the car speed should be kept within the following recommendations:</p>

<p class="i2">0-250 MILES</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Do not exceed 40 miles per hour in high gear or 20 miles per hour in second.
Do not accelerate rapidly. Use second gear on steep grades. Keep motor
temperature within "driving range" on dash heat indicator.</p></div>

<p class="i2">250-500 MILES</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Do not exceed 50 miles per hour in high gear or 25 miles per hour in
second.</p></div>

<p class="i2">500-1000 MILES</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>During this period the speed should not exceed 60 miles per hour.</p></div>


<p class="title">IMPORTANT</p>

<p>Do not UNDER ANY CONSIDERATION attempt to maintain a high
rate of speed unless the crankcase is full of good oil and until the engine is
thoroughly warmed up. Cold oil is not able to flow freely into the small
clearances between working parts so that damage may occur if sufficient time
is not allowed for warming up before attempting high speeds.</p>

<p>If the engine is cold, pull the choke knob out as far as possible, turn the
ignition switch key to the right, depress the accelerator pedal slightly, and
pull the starter knob out. When the engine "fires," push the choke knob in
until the engine runs evenly. Return the choke knob gradually to the full in
position as the engine warms up. The choke knob should never be out any
farther than necessary to maintain even running of the engine.</p>

<p>If the engine is warm from previous running, use the choke sparingly. In
most instances the engine will start immediately without the use of the choke
if the accelerator pedal is held in a slightly depressed position while the starter
is used. Do not under any circumstances work the accelerator pedal rapidly
when starting as the accelerator pump may flood the carburetor.</p>

<p><b>Oil Signal</b>&mdash;The red signal on the left hand indicates oil pressure and the
functioning of the oiling system. It will glow when the ignition switch is
turned on but will go out when the car is under way. Should it continue to
burn or flash while the car is under way, it indicates that the oil supply is low
or that the oiling system is not functioning properly. Do not run the engine
until the oil supply has been replenished or trouble corrected.</p>

<p><b>Generator Signal</b>&mdash;The red signal on the right hand will light when the
ignition switch is turned on and will be lighted at all times unless the engine is
running at higher than idling speed. Should this signal glow at normal running
speeds, it indicates that the generator is not charging and should be inspected
immediately by an Essex dealer.</p>

<p>If cold weather prevails, be sure
the oil you use will flow at the
temperatures encountered. Oil supply
should be maintained at the full mark
on the bayonet gauge at the oil filler.</p>

<p>The frequency with which oil
should be drained and replenished
with new depends largely on the
operation of the car. Consult your
dealer for recommendations on your
car. In any event the oil should be
changed at least every 2500 miles.</p>

<p>Use only a mixture composed of
1/2 kerosene and 1/2 engine oil. Turn
starter shaft with wrench, moving
wrench handle toward the engine
until plug "A" is accessible through
opening in rear engine plate. Remove
plug "A," continue turning flywheel
until opening is down and all clutch
oil is drained. Then turn until opening
is again accessible. Pour in by
means of offset funnel no more than
1/3 pint of clutch mixture. Replace
plug "A" and tighten securely.
The clutch oil should be drained and
replenished at least every 5000 miles.</p>

<p>The clutch throwout bearing should
be lubricated with one ounce of light
viscous grease<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> every 500 miles. A
pressure fitting is provided on the

<p>Remove distributor cap and inspect
points. High points can be removed
by placing a breaker point file between
points and letting them close against
file under their normal spring pressure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Move file straight up and down,
dressing both points at the same time.
If the points are pitted, they should
be ground or replaced.</p>

<p>Crank engine, using wrench on
starter shaft extension, until the
breaker arm fibre block is on the
highest point of the cam, giving the
points their maximum opening. If
necessary to adjust, loosen lock nut
"D" and turn screw "E" until the gap
is .020" (.50 mm.). Tighten lock nut.</p>

<p>Remove the spark plug from number
one cylinder. Crank the engine
slowly by hand until air is forced out
through the spark plug hole. Continue

<p>Unless you are an experienced
mechanic, it is advisable to have your
brakes adjusted by your Essex dealer.
The following operation will, however,
take care of normal brake shoe
wear if done carefully:</p>

<p>Jack up car, remove all four wheels
and remove the inspection covers
from the front of the brake drums.
Disconnect the four brake cables from
the cross shaft; turn the brake drum
until the inspection hole is 1-1/2" from
the adjusting screw end of the lining
of the upper shoe (rear of front brakes&mdash;front
of rear brakes).</p>

<p>Insert a .014" (.35 mm.) feeler
through the inspection hole. Loosen eccentric lock nut "A" and turn eccentric
"B" in the direction the wheel rotates when the car is moving forward until the
feeler is held snugly between the drum and the lining. Hold the eccentric in this
position and tighten lock nut "A." Make this adjustment on all four brakes.</p>

<p>Turn brake drum until inspection hole is 1-1/2" from adjusting screw end of
the lining of the lower shoe (rear of front brakes&mdash;front of rear brakes). Insert a
.008" (.15 mm.) feeler through inspection hole. Insert a screwdriver through
opening "C" and turn star wheel until feeler is held snugly. Move the handle
of the screwdriver toward the axle to tighten brakes. Make this adjustment on
all four wheels.</p>

<p>Reconnect the brake cables at the cross shaft, adjusting the position of the
cable yoke so that the clevis pin can just be inserted in the yoke and cross shaft
lever hole when the cable is held just taut enough to remove slack.</p>

<p>If trial on road shows too much braking on one wheel, loosen that brake by
turning star wheel with screwdriver one notch at a time until the brake is
equal with the others. Always loosen the tight brake&mdash;do not tighten the loose
brakes or the pedal travel will be restricted and may cause brake drag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 589px;">
<img src="images/image018.png" width="589" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>After jacking up front axle and removing
the hub cap, withdraw cotter
key holding nut "A." Turn nut "A"
to the right until a slight drag is felt
when turning the wheel slightly by
hand. Then loosen the nut just sufficiently
to permit the wheel to turn
freely. Insert cotter key.</p>


<h3><a name="Rear_Wheel_Bearings" id="Rear_Wheel_Bearings"></a>Rear Wheel Bearings</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">
<img src="images/image019.png" width="421" height="541" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>To adjust rear wheel bearings, jack
up rear axle and remove both rear
wheels. Remove the four nuts from
bearing cap "A" and remove cap.
By removing shims "B" under the
cap the end play of the axle shaft is
decreased. Total play between axle
shafts should be from .005" to .010"
(.12 to .25 mm.) which is perceptible by
pulling shaft in and out with the hand.
It is necessary that the thickness of
shims at each rear wheel be approximately
the same, so when adjusting
remove a thin shim from each side and
repeat, if necessary, until only a slight
amount of play is evident. Be sure the
axle shafts turn freely before building
up.</p>


<h3><a name="Removing_and_Installing_Wheels" id="Removing_and_Installing_Wheels"></a>Removing and Installing Wheels</h3>

<p>To remove a wheel, place a screwdriver between the hub cap and hub and
pry off cap. Loosen the four cap screws "B" (illustration <a href="#Front_Wheel_Bearings">top of page</a>) with the
socket wrench provided. Remove one cap screw in the lowest position and
insert the handle of the wrench through the screw hole into the hub. While
holding the wheel in position with the wrench, remove the other cap screws
and lift off the wheel. The wheels should be jacked up just sufficiently to clear
the ground. When replacing the wheel, place the handle of the wrench through
the lower cap screw hole, lift up on the wrench so that the wheel will clear the
ground and push in place. Align by moving wrench back and forth. Then
start two of the cap screws, remove the wrench and start the remaining two.
Tighten every other cap screw until all are down enough to hold wheel in
place, making sure it is square on the hub. Continue tightening every other
screw until all are secure.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
